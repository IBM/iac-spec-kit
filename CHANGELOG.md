## About IAC Spec Kit

**IAC Spec Kit** is a domain-specific implementation of the spec-driven development pattern optimized for Infrastructure as Code workflows. This project is forked from the original [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) which focuses on general software development.

**For the complete changelog history prior to the IAC fork, please refer to the [original GitHub Spec Kit changelog](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).**

IAC Spec Kit provides infrastructure-specific templates, constitutional principles, cloud resource specifications, and Terraform patterns. All infrastructure commands use the `.iac` namespace (e.g., `/speckit.iac.specify`, `/speckit.iac.plan`, `/speckit.iac.tasks`).
