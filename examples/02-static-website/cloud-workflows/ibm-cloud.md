# IBM Cloud Workflow for Static Website

This guide shows the commands and prompts to deploy a static website on IBM Cloud using IaC Spec Kit.

> **Note**: The specific files, directory names, and some outputs are generated by the AI and will vary depending on your AI tool (Bob, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) and the LLM model being used. The workflow structure and file types remain consistent.

## Prerequisites

- IBM Cloud account with Pay-As-You-Go plan
- IBM Cloud CLI installed and configured (`ibmcloud login`)
- IaC Spec Kit installed (`iac-specify check`)
- Terraform installed
- AI coding assistant running in your project directory

## Commands

### Step 1: Establish Project Principles

```
/iac.principles I'm deploying a simple marketing website on IBM Cloud. Keep costs low, use managed services, use Terraform.
```

**Generates**: `.specify/memory/principles.md`

---

### Step 2: Describe What You Want

```
/iac.specify I need to host a static marketing website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Should load fast globally using a CDN. Need HTTPS support and ideally a custom domain. Budget is minimal, under $10/month for low to moderate traffic.
```

**Generates**: `spec.md`, `checklists/requirements.md`

**spec.md** contains cloud-agnostic requirements for object storage, CDN, SSL/TLS, and custom domain support. Specific sections vary by AI tool and LLM model.

---

### Step 3: Clarify Requirements (Optional)

```
/iac.clarify
```

**Updates**: `spec.md`

---

### Step 4: Create Implementation Plan

**Option A - Minimal**:
```
/iac.plan
```

**Option B - With custom domain**:
```
/iac.plan I have the domain example.com. Use IBM Cloud CDN and Cloud Object Storage.
```

**Generates**: `plan.md`, `research.md`, `architecture.md`, `modules.md`, `quickstart.md`

**plan.md** example architecture:
- Storage: Cloud Object Storage bucket with public access
- CDN: IBM Cloud CDN powered by Akamai
- SSL: SSL certificate for HTTPS
- DNS: IBM Cloud Internet Services or DNS Services for custom domain (if applicable)

Specific services vary by AI tool and LLM model.

---

### Step 5: Generate Task Breakdown

```
/iac.tasks
```

**Generates**: `tasks.md`

**tasks.md** example tasks:
- Create COS bucket in iac/cos.tf
- Configure CDN mapping in iac/cdn.tf
- Set up SSL certificate in iac/ssl.tf
- Configure DNS records in iac/dns.tf (if custom domain)

Specific tasks vary by AI tool and LLM model.

---

### Step 6: Implement Infrastructure Code

```
/iac.implement
```

**Generates**: Terraform files. Example files might include:
- backend.tf, provider.tf
- cos.tf (Cloud Object Storage)
- cdn.tf (CDN configuration), ssl.tf, dns.tf
- outputs.tf

The AI runs `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`. Specific files vary by AI tool and LLM model.

---

## What Happens Next

After `/iac.implement`:

1. Review code, initialize Terraform, review plan
2. Deploy: `terraform apply`
3. Upload content using IBM Cloud CLI or SDK
4. Access via CDN URL or custom domain

## Files Generated Summary

| Command | Files Created | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| `/iac.principles` | `principles.md` | Project governance rules |
| `/iac.specify` | `spec.md`, `checklists/requirements.md` | Cloud-agnostic requirements |
| `/iac.plan` | `plan.md`, `research.md`, `architecture.md`, etc. | IBM Cloud-specific architecture |
| `/iac.tasks` | `tasks.md` | Ordered task breakdown |
| `/iac.implement` | `*.tf` files | Terraform code |
