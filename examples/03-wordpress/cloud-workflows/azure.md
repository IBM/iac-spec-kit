# Azure Workflow for WordPress Deployment

This guide shows the commands and prompts to deploy WordPress infrastructure on Azure using IaC Spec Kit.

> **Note**: The specific files, directory names, and some outputs are generated by the AI and will vary depending on your AI tool (Bob, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) and the LLM model being used. The workflow structure and file types remain consistent.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- IaC Spec Kit installed (`iac-specify check`)
- Terraform installed
- AI coding assistant running in your project directory

## Commands

### Step 1: Establish Project Principles

```
/iac.principles This is a small business production website. Keep it simple but include security and automated backups. Keep costs reasonable. Use Terraform.
```

**What this does**: The AI generates governance rules for your project covering architecture principles, code principles, and implementation approaches.

**Generates**: `.specify/memory/principles.md`

**principles.md** contains versioned governance rules including architecture principles (like security defaults, resource tagging), code principles (like prefer curated modules, testing requirements), implementation approaches (like progressive complexity), and amendment procedures. Specific principles and their wording vary by AI tool and LLM model.

---

### Step 2: Describe What You Want

```
/iac.specify I need to deploy WordPress for my small business website. Should handle a few thousand visitors per day, needs to be secure with automated backups. Budget is around $500/month. Use the official WordPress Docker image.
```

**What this does**: The AI creates a cloud-agnostic infrastructure specification. If anything is critically ambiguous, it will ask up to 3 clarifying questions.

**Generates**:
- `spec.md` in a feature directory (directory name is AI-generated based on your description)
- `checklists/requirements.md` for quality validation

**spec.md** contains a cloud-agnostic specification with sections like executive summary, problem statement, infrastructure requirements, SLOs, cost constraints, success criteria, and assumptions. For example, functional requirements might include:
- Compute resources for containerized applications
- Managed relational database with automated backups
- Object storage for media files
- Load balancer for traffic distribution
- Isolated network with public/private separation

Uses generic terms rather than cloud-specific services (e.g., "managed database" not "Azure Database for MySQL"). Specific sections and detail vary by AI tool and LLM model.

---

### Step 3: Clarify Requirements (Optional)

```
/iac.clarify
```

**What this does**: The AI scans your spec for underspecified areas and asks targeted questions (max 5 per session). Questions are presented with multiple-choice options and the AI recommends answers.

**Updates**: `spec.md` with your answers integrated

---

### Step 4: Create Implementation Plan

**You can provide varying levels of detail.** The framework already knows from your principles and spec that you want Azure, cost-effective setup, containerized WordPress, etc. Only add details if you have specific requirements not already captured.

**Option A - Minimal**:
```
/iac.plan
```

**Option B - Basic guidance**:
```
/iac.plan Use East US region
```

**Option C - Some direction**:
```
/iac.plan Deploy in East US. Prefer Azure managed services.
```

**Option D - More specific**:
```
/iac.plan Deploy in East US. Use Container Instances for containers, Azure Database for MySQL, Blob Storage for media.
```

**Option E - Very detailed**:
```
/iac.plan Deploy in East US. Use Azure Container Instances for WordPress with Application Gateway. Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server with automated backups. Blob Storage for media with CDN. Virtual Network with subnets. Use Azure Verified Modules.
```

**What this does**: The AI researches Azure best practices, well-architected framework pillars, and Azure Verified Modules. It then designs the complete infrastructure architecture and generates planning documents.

**Generates**:
- `plan.md` - Main architecture plan
- `research.md` - Technology decisions and justifications
- `architecture.md` - Detailed component specifications
- `modules.md` - Terraform module specifications (if using modules)
- `quickstart.md` - Deployment procedures
- Updates agent-specific context files

**plan.md** contains the main architecture plan including technical context (Azure, Terraform, state backend), principles validation, and infrastructure architecture. For example:
- Compute: Azure Container Instances with auto-scaling
- Storage: Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server and Blob Storage for media
- Networking: Virtual Network with subnets and Application Gateway

Specific services and implementation details vary by AI tool and LLM model.

**research.md** contains technology decisions and justifications. May include:
- Cloud provider rationale
- Well-Architected Framework mappings (e.g., Security → network isolation and encryption, Cost Optimization → appropriate SKUs)
- Curated modules identified (Azure Verified Modules)
- Best practices and patterns

Content and depth vary by AI tool and LLM model.

**architecture.md** contains detailed component specifications, resource dependencies, configuration parameters, and possibly network topology diagrams. Level of detail varies by AI tool and LLM model.

**modules.md** (if generated) contains module specifications with input/output variables and dependencies. Whether this file is created and its content vary by AI tool and LLM model.

**quickstart.md** contains deployment procedures including prerequisites, initialization steps, and deployment commands. Specific steps and detail level vary by AI tool and LLM model.

---

### Step 5: Generate Task Breakdown

```
/iac.tasks
```

**What this does**: The AI creates a phased task list organized by infrastructure tiers with clear execution order and parallelization opportunities.

**Generates**: `tasks.md`

**tasks.md** contains an ordered task breakdown organized by tiers (Setup, Foundation, Network, Compute/Data, Application, Validation). Each task has checkbox format with ID, parallel marker [P], and file path. Example tasks:
- Create Virtual Network and subnets in iac/vnet.tf
- Configure Container Instances in iac/containers.tf
- Set up Azure Database in iac/database.tf

Specific tasks and organization vary by AI tool and LLM model.

---

### Step 6: Implement Infrastructure Code

```
/iac.implement
```

**What this does**: The AI executes tasks to generate Terraform .tf files, runs formatting and validation, and marks completed tasks.

**Important**: This generates infrastructure code only - it does NOT deploy to Azure (no `terraform apply`).

**Generates**: Terraform configuration files (`.tf` files). Example files might include:
- backend.tf (Azure Storage state)
- provider.tf (Azure provider config)
- vnet.tf (Virtual Network and subnets)
- containers.tf (Container Instances), database.tf (Azure Database for MySQL), storage.tf (Blob Storage)
- gateway.tf (Application Gateway), nsg.tf, outputs.tf

The AI also runs `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`. Specific files and organization vary by AI tool and LLM model.

**Updates**: `tasks.md` with completed tasks marked as `- [X]`

---

## What Happens Next

After `/iac.implement` completes, you have production-ready Terraform code. The next steps are **manual**:

1. Review the generated code
2. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
3. Review execution plan: `terraform plan`
4. Deploy to Azure: `terraform apply` (creates real resources and incurs costs)
5. Access your WordPress site using the output values

---

## Key Points to Remember

- **Directory names are AI-generated**: The AI decides based on your description.
- **Results vary by AI tool**: Different tools may generate slightly different organizations.
- **Principles are project-wide**: They apply to ALL features, not just WordPress.
- **Specs are technology-agnostic**: Uses generic terms, not Azure-specific services.
- **Plans are Azure-specific**: Contains Azure service names and Azure Verified Modules.
- **Deployment is manual**: You run `terraform apply` to create actual Azure resources.
- **Cost awareness**: `terraform apply` creates real resources that cost money.
